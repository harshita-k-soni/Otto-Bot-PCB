# Otto-Bot-PCB
Crafted a breakout board designed specifically for building the Otto Desk Bot, a popular project in the robotics community. This board incorporates essential components including the Arduino Nano, OLED display, HC-05 Bluetooth module, and servo motors. Created using KiCad 7, this breakout board streamlines the process of integrating these components, making it easier for hobbyists and enthusiasts to assemble the Otto Desk Bot.

<b>Tips:</b>
--> Download schematic(.sch) file, looking at the code may be intimidating but it's just a matter of symbols and wires in kiCad.
-->Open the schematic file in kiCad, run ERC. If everything is ok then proceed to routing.
-->There are plugins available to auto route but routing the pcb yourself is always a wiser choice . Also , it is just a breakout board, so routings are not so difficult.
-->Use 0.5mm width of traces since thinner trace provides higher resistance
-->Avoid 90 degree turns of copper traces.
